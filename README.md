# WS2API PHP

This is a port of the [WS2API](https://github.com/mevdschee/ws2api) project into
Swow.

Both implementations are 200 lines of code and this project performs worse than 
the original that is written in Go.

### Swow vs. OpenSwoole

I'm probably not using Swow correctly as I'm not achieving the same results as
I do in OpenSwoole.
